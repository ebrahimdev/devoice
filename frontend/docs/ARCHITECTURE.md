# DeVoice Architecture

## Vision
DeVoice is a revolutionary development environment that democratizes software creation by allowing different stakeholders to interact with the system through their natural domain language and perspective. Instead of forcing everyone to think in terms of code and technical implementation, DeVoice provides specialized views that match each stakeholder's expertise and needs.

## Core Concepts

### Business Logic Layer (BLL)
The foundation of DeVoice is the Business Logic Layer, which represents the pure business rules, workflows, and requirements of the system. This layer is technology-agnostic and focuses on what the system should do, not how it should do it.

### Domain-Specific Views
Each stakeholder interacts with the system through a view that matches their expertise:

#### Product Manager View
- Feature specifications
- User stories
- Business requirements
- Release planning
- Market analysis

#### Developer View
- System architecture
- Implementation details
- Technical dependencies
- Code structure
- Quality metrics

#### UX Designer View
- User flows
- Interface designs
- Interaction patterns
- User research
- Accessibility requirements

#### Business Analyst View
- Business rules
- Process flows
- Data models
- Compliance requirements
- Integration points

### Transformation Engine
The Transformation Engine is the core component that:
1. Converts between different domain-specific views
2. Maintains consistency across all perspectives
3. Handles conflict resolution
4. Manages version control
5. Tracks changes and their impact

## Key Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design
- Each view is a bounded context
- Clear separation of concerns
- Domain-specific language for each perspective
- Ubiquitous language within each context

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture
- Real-time updates across views
- Asynchronous processing
- Event sourcing for audit trails
- CQRS for query optimization

### 3. Flexible Transformation Rules
- Bidirectional transformations
- Custom transformation rules
- Validation at each step
- Conflict resolution strategies

### 4. Version Control and History
- Complete history of changes
- Branching and merging support
- Rollback capabilities
- Audit trails

## Technical Implementation

### Data Model
```typescript
interface BusinessEntity {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  metadata: {
    created: Date;
    modified: Date;
    createdBy: string;
    modifiedBy: string;
    version: number;
  };
  relationships: {
    [key: string]: string[];
  };
}

interface View {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  entities: {
    [key: string]: ViewEntity;
  };
  relationships: {
    [key: string]: string[];
  };
}

interface TransformationRule {
  sourceType: string;
  targetType: string;
  transform: (entity: BusinessEntity) => ViewEntity;
  validate: (entity: ViewEntity) => boolean;
}
```

### Synchronization Strategy
1. Event-based updates
2. Optimistic locking
3. Conflict resolution
4. Version control
5. Audit logging

## Future Considerations

### Extensibility
- Custom view types
- Plugin architecture
- Integration capabilities
- Custom transformation rules

### Integration
- External tool integration
- API support
- Import/Export capabilities
- Webhook support

### Security
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging
- Data encryption
- Compliance tracking

## Terminology
- **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**: The core representation of system behavior
- **Domain-Specific View**: A specialized perspective of the system
- **Transformation Engine**: The system that converts between views
- **Business Entity**: A fundamental unit of business logic
- **View Entity**: A representation of a business entity in a specific view
- **Transformation Rule**: A rule that defines how to convert between views

## Next Steps
1. Implement core BLL
2. Create basic view system
3. Develop transformation engine
4. Add version control
5. Implement conflict resolution
6. Add audit logging
7. Create UI for different views
